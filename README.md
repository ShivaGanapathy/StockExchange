# StockExchange
Order book and Matching engine simulator built in C++
# Plans
This project will be implemented in C++, and create TCP client-server connections as a way for clients to communicate. If time permits, I will add persistence to the server.
# Benchmarking
There will also be performance benchmarks as I find ways to optimize the application.

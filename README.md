# StockExchange
Order book and Matching engine simulator built in C++
# Current Project Status
The application is currently able to add limit orders from tcp clients to the Centralized Limit Order Book in the server. I am currently working on using the strategy design pattern to implement several different matching algorithms such as price-time priority and pro-rata.
# Benchmarking
There will also be performance benchmarks as I find ways to optimize the application.
